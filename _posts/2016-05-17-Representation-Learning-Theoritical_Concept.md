Representation Learning is a feature learning framework in machine learning system which provides a deep generation of several important features.  

Represating Learning deals with represetation of latent features extract from original row data or input information. This represation may be hierarchical, distributed, sparse , dense according to the information processing  system.  An information processing system which deals with image feature extraction  extracts the geometric orientation , correlation connectivity, color pixels sentitivity , modularization and connections of diffrent subcomponent the image . For Protein 3D Structute synthesis , the represention means that deals with the complex geometric 3d features that are related with 3d Objects with complex shapes. For Parsing a Text , distributed represtation  moslty deals with .
Exponinal growth of Data provides an extreme amount of Variations , Noise , Parameters growth that suggest a  represation system that decomposes features  in a lightweigted and adaptable way before is to be fed with a machine learning system.  

So Represating Learning is the rich represation of the latent information of an object that is suitable for  machine trainable.



Represetation Learning + Machine Learning => provides a research area Deep Learning  . 

<h3>Deep Learning has some features</h3>

1. Contains  a deep architecure a lot of layer which are pluggble or hierarchically distributed  

2. Use Represating Learning for automatic feature extraction which is one of fundametnatal advantages of deep learning.

3. Highly adaptable system that accpets the meaninful logical binding of a lot of layer and for a given homogeous inputs a sparse structure are activated .

4. Distributed processing is maintained in different layers to  reveal the crucial identical informations.


<h3>Goal</h3>
A good representation can adapt a lot of variations and noise and gives a better learning elements to a classifier system.
